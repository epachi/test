Looking at this problem, I can see it's asking for the number of ways to climb a ladder with N rungs, where you can take 1 or 2 steps at a time. This is essentially the Fibonacci sequence!
The pattern is:

F(1) = 1 way (just step 1)
F(2) = 2 ways (1+1 or 2)
F(3) = 3 ways (1+1+1, 1+2, 2+1)
F(4) = 5 ways (as shown in the example)
F(5) = 8 ways (as shown in the example)

So F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n ≥ 3.
The key optimization here is that we need to return results modulo 2^B[i], and since we have multiple queries,
we should precompute the Fibonacci numbers modulo the largest possible modulus (2^30) to handle all queries efficiently.Ladder Climbing Ways CounterCode class Solution {
    public int[] solution(int[] A, int[] B) {
        int L = A.length;
        int[] result = new int[L];

        // Find the maximum N value to precompute Fibonacci numbers up to that point
        int maxN = 0;
        foThe solution works as follows:
Key Insights:

Fibonacci Pattern: The number of ways to climb N rungs follows the Fibonacci sequence where F(1)=1, F(2)=2, and F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
Precomputation: Since we have multiple queries, we precompute all Fibonacci numbers up to the maximum N value
Modular Arithmetic: We compute Fibonacci numbers modulo 2^30 (the largest possible modulus) to handle overflow and then apply the specific modulus 2^B[i] for each query

Algorithm Steps:

Find the maximum N value in array A to determine how many Fibonacci numbers to precompute
Calculate Fibonacci numbers up to max N using modulo 2^30 to prevent overflow
For each query (A[i], B[i]), return the precomputed F(A[i]) modulo 2^B[i]

Time Complexity: O(max(A) + L) where L is the length of arrays
Space Complexity: O(max(A)) for storing precomputed Fibonacci numbers
Example Walkthrough:

For N=4: F(4) = 5, and 5 mod 2^3 = 5 mod 8 = 5
For N=4: F(4) = 5, and 5 mod 2^2 = 5 mod 4 = 1
For N=5: F(5) = 8, and 8 mod 2^4 = 8 mod 16 = 8
For N=5: F(5) = 8, and 8 mod 2^3 = 8 mod 8 = 0
For N=1: F(1) = 1, and 1 mod 2^1 = 1 mod 2 = 1

This gives us the expected result [5, 1, 8, 0, 1].
