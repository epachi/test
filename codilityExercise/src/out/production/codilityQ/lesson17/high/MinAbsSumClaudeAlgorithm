Looking at this problem, I need to find a sequence S of +1 and -1 values that minimizes the absolute value of the sum A[i] * S[i].
This is essentially asking: given an array A, how can I assign + or - signs to each element to get a sum as close to 0 as possible?
This is a classic subset sum problem variant. I can think of it as: which elements should I keep positive (+1) and which should I make negative (-1)
to minimize the absolute sum?
Let me analyze the approach:

Calculate the total sum of absolute values
This becomes a problem of finding a subset that sums as close as possible to half the total sum
Use dynamic programming to solve this efficiently
Minimum val(A,S) SolutionCode class Solution {
    public int solution(int[] A) {
        if (A.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Calculate sum of absolute values
        int totalSum = 0;
        for (int num : A) {
            totalSum += Math.aThe solution works as follows:
Key Insights:

Each element A[i] can be multiplied by either +1 or -1
We want to minimize |∑(A[i] * S[i])|
This is equivalent to partitioning elements into two groups: positive and negative
We want |sum_positive - sum_negative| to be minimal

Algorithm:

Calculate the total sum of absolute values of all elements
Use dynamic programming to find if we can achieve any sum from 0 to totalSum/2
Find the largest achievable sum ≤ totalSum/2
The minimum possible value is |totalSum - 2 * closestSum|

Why this works:

If we can achieve sum S with some subset, then sum_positive = S and sum_negative = totalSum - S
The difference is |S - (totalSum - S)| = |2S - totalSum|
To minimize this, we want S as close as possible to totalSum/2

Time Complexity: O(N * sum) where sum is the total of absolute values
Space Complexity: O(sum)
For the example A = [1, 5, 2, -2]:

Total sum of absolute values = 1 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 10
Target = 5
We can achieve sum 5 with elements {5} or {1, 2, 2}
Result = |10 - 2*5| = 0

The solution handles all edge cases including empty arrays and negative numbers correctly.
