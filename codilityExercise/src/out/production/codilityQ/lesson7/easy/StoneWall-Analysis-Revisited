I don't have the ability to directly view images. However, based on the text you provided which describes the problem from the image, I can help you resolve it using Java.

The problem asks us to find the minimum number of cuboid stone blocks needed to build a wall of a given height profile. The wall is N meters long, and its thickness is constant. The height at each meter i (from i to i+1) is given by H[i]. H[0] is the height at the left end, and H[N-1] is the height at the right end.

Here's an efficient Java solution using a stack-based approach. The core idea is to think about filling the wall layer by layer or by finding the contiguous blocks that can be formed. A more intuitive and efficient approach for this problem is a "stack-based" solution, similar to finding the largest rectangle in a histogram, but adapted for counting blocks. However, a simpler and more direct approach for this specific problem (counting blocks to build the wall) is often to process it iteratively, "level by level" or by identifying horizontal segments.

Let's refine the "level by level" idea: we can think of this as removing horizontal layers of bricks. Each time we "remove" a layer, we count how many contiguous segments of bricks were in that layer.

A more direct and common approach for this type of problem is to use a "divide and conquer" strategy or an iterative "skyline" approach.

Let's consider an iterative approach. We can count the number of blocks by iterating through the heights and keeping track of the 
"current base" height. Each time the height changes, we might need a new block. 
However, this is not quite right because a single long block can span across varying heights if its top is flat.

The key insight for this problem is often to consider how many horizontal blocks we can place.
Imagine you have the wall. You want to place the widest possible blocks.
When you look at the wall from the top, you'd see a series of horizontal segments.

Let's simplify. We want to count the minimum number of rectangular blocks. This means we should try to make blocks as wide as possible.

Consider the example: H = [8, 8, 5, 7, 9, 8, 7, 4, 8]
If we "fill" from the bottom:
Level 1: All positions have at least height 1. This forms a block of width 9. Count = 1.
Remaining: H = [7, 7, 4, 6, 8, 7, 6, 3, 7]

This "level by level" subtraction approach is correct, but can be slow if heights are very large. We can optimize it.

The optimal strategy involves using a stack to keep track of increasing heights. When we encounter a height 
smaller than the top of the stack, it means we can potentially "close" some blocks.

Let's rethink this as finding horizontal blocks. A block is horizontal if it starts at some i, ends at some j, and has a uniform height h. 
The minimum number of blocks implies we should make them as wide as possible.

Consider a simpler approach:
We iterate through the heights. If the current height H[i] is greater than the previous height H[i-1], 
it means we need to add new "material" upwards, which will contribute to new blocks (or extensions of existing ones). 
If H[i] is less than H[i-1], it means the "current" horizontal block (if any) might end or we might be starting a new one at a lower level.

The problem is equivalent to counting the number of "start" points of horizontal segments.
Imagine a line sweeping from left to right.
We need a block whenever the current height H[i] is greater than the current "base" height of the structure we've built up to this point.

Let's use a stack to keep track of the heights that are currently "open" for horizontal blocks.
When we encounter a new height H[i]:

Pop elements from the stack that are greater than H[i]. These elements represent blocks that cannot extend past i at their current height.

If H[i] is greater than the top of the stack (or the stack is empty), it means we are starting a new block at this height, so increment the block count and push H[i] onto the stack.

If H[i] is equal to the top of the stack, it means the current block can extend, so we don't do anything to the count or stack.

This is very similar to counting "hills" or "valleys."

Let's try an example with this stack approach: H = [8, 8, 5, 7, 9, 8, 7, 4, 8]

Initialize blocks = 0, stack = empty

i = 0, H[0] = 8:
Stack is empty. Push 8. stack = [8]. blocks = 1 (starting a new block at height 8).

i = 1, H[1] = 8:
H[1] (8) is equal to stack top (8). Do nothing. stack = [8]. blocks = 1.

i = 2, H[2] = 5:
H[2] (5) is less than stack top (8). Pop 8. stack = [].
Stack is empty. Push 5. stack = [5]. blocks = 2 (started a new block at height 5).

i = 3, H[3] = 7:
H[3] (7) is greater than stack top (5). Push 7. stack = [5, 7]. blocks = 3 (started new block at height 7).

i = 4, H[4] = 9:
H[4] (9) is greater than stack top (7). Push 9. stack = [5, 7, 9]. blocks = 4 (started new block at height 9).

i = 5, H[5] = 8:
H[5] (8) is less than stack top (9). Pop 9. stack = [5, 7].
H[5] (8) is greater than stack top (7). Push 8. stack = [5, 7, 8]. blocks = 5 (started new block at height 8).

i = 6, H[6] = 7:
H[6] (7) is less than stack top (8). Pop 8. stack = [5, 7].
H[6] (7) is equal to stack top (7). Do nothing. stack = [5, 7]. blocks = 5.

i = 7, H[7] = 4:
H[7] (4) is less than stack top (7). Pop 7. stack = [5].
H[7] (4) is less than stack top (5). Pop 5. stack = [].
Stack is empty. Push 4. stack = [4]. blocks = 6 (started new block at height 4).

i = 8, H[8] = 8:
H[8] (8) is greater than stack top (4). Push 8. stack = [4, 8]. blocks = 7 (started new block at height 8).

Final blocks = 7. This matches the example!

This stack-based approach seems correct and efficient.

Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: Each element H[i] is pushed onto the stack at most once and popped from the stack at most once. Therefore, the time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of elements in H.

Space Complexity: In the worst case (e.g., a strictly increasing height profile), the stack can store all N elements. Therefore, the space complexity is O(N).

Given the constraints (N up to 100,000 and heights up to 1,000,000,000), an O(N) time and O(N) space solution is efficient enough.
