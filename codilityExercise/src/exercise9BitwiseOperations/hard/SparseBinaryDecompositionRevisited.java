//Decompose int into sum of ints having no consecutive 1s in binary form.
//
//A non-negative integer N is called sparse if its binary representation does not contain two consecutive bits set to 1.
// For example, 41 is sparse, because its binary representation is "101001" and it does not contain two consecutive 1s.
// On the other hand, 26 is not sparse, because its binary representation is "11010" and it contains two consecutive 1s.
//
//        Two non-negative integers P and Q are called a sparse decomposition of integer N if P and Q are sparse and N = P + Q.
//
//        For example:
//
//        8 and 18 are a sparse decomposition of 26 (binary representation of 8 is "1000", binary representation of 18 is "10010");
//        9 and 17 are a sparse decomposition of 26 (binary representation of 9 is "1001", binary representation of 17 is "10001");
//        2 and 24 are not a sparse decomposition of 26; though 2 + 24 = 26, the binary representation of 24 is "11000", which is not sparse.
//        Write a function:
//
//class Solution { public int solution(int N); }
//
//that, given a non-negative integer N, returns any integer that is one part of a sparse decomposition of N.
// The function should return âˆ’1 if there is no sparse decomposition of N.
//
//        For example, given N = 26 the function may return 8, 9, 17 or 18, as explained in the example above.
//        All other possible results for N = 26 are 5, 10, 16 and 21.
//
//        Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
//
//        N is an integer within the range [0..1,000,000,000].

//In this implementation, the solution function iterates through the bits of the binary representation of N and checks for consecutive 1s. If found, it flips one of them to 0 and checks if the resulting number is sparse using the isSparse function. If a sparse decomposition is found, it returns one of the numbers in the decomposition; otherwise, it returns -1.

//        The isSparse function checks if a given number is sparse by iterating through its bits and checking for consecutive 1s. If consecutive 1s are found, the function returns false; otherwise, it returns true.
//
//        This algorithm has a time complexity of O(log N) due to the conversion to binary representation, and the space complexity is O(1).
