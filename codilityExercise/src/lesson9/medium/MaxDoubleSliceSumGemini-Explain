Of course. I can provide a Java solution for this programming exercise.

Here is a complete, well-commented Java implementation that finds the maximal sum of any double slice in a given array.

Explanation of the Algorithm
This solution efficiently solves the problem using a dynamic programming approach,
which is a variation of Kadane's algorithm for maximum slice problems.

Understanding the Double Slice Sum: The core of the problem is that for any chosen middle element Y,
the sum of the double slice is the sum of the largest possible slice ending just before Y
and the largest possible slice starting just after Y.

maxEndingHere Array: We create an array maxEndingHere to store the maximum sum of any slice that ends at a given index i.
We traverse the array from left to right. For each position i, the maximum sum ending there is either the value A[i] itself
or A[i] plus the maximum sum that ended at i-1. We take Math.max(0, ...) to ensure that we don't include negative slice sums,
as we can always start a new slice (with sum 0) at any point.

maxStartingHere Array: Similarly, we create an array maxStartingHere to store the maximum sum of any slice starting at index i.
This is calculated by traversing the array from right to left.

Finding the Maximum: With these two arrays prepared, we can find the maximal double slice sum.
We iterate through all possible positions for the middle element Y (from index 1 to N-2).
For each position i, the sum of the double slice is maxEndingHere[i-1] + maxStartingHere[i+1].
We keep track of the largest sum found during this iteration.

This approach has a time complexity of O(N) because it involves three separate passes through the array,
and a space complexity of O(N) for the two auxiliary arrays. This is highly efficient and meets the constraints of the problem.
